# .NET and C-Sharp
This repository contains my all my projects containing C# and .NET Framework. Most of these projects are console applications that proficient in the core concepts of C# and .NET Framework. Other projects are examples of MVC web applications like the Car Insurance project.  
## Projects
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/TVisi0n/.NET-and-C-Sharp/tree/main/CarInsurance2)
* [Student Database](https://github.com/TVisi0n/.NET-and-C-Sharp/tree/main/StudentDB)
* [File Transfer](https://github.com/TVisi0n/.NET-and-C-Sharp/tree/main/FileTransfer)
### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application. It is supposed to imitate a car insurance website. The user inputs their information into the create view and based on their information the site will calculate the monthly quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all current policy users hold and their monthly quote.
### Student Database
This is a basic console application to allow a user to enter a students credentials and save it to a database. This was made using the Entity Framework and used the Code-First approach, which created classes for the domain entity.
### File Transfer
This project is a work in progress but its purpose will be to transfer any .xml or .config files from the downloads folder to the trash bin. I work with a lot of .xml and .config files in my day to day so I thought it would be a great idea to automate this process.
